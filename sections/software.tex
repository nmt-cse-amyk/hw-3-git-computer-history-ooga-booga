AMD has a variety of different software to serve different purposes. Although they initially started as a hardware company over the years they have begun to diverge and focus on tackling issues on the software side of things. The following are a few of the different softwares used by AMD, particularly in relation to the AMD Ryzen.
\\ROCm: A piece of software designed to provide a foundation for advanced computers by integrating the CPU and the GPU.
\\AMD Infinity Hub: A collection of GPU containers and guides for HP, AI, and Machine Learning to allow researchers to have better access to the information needed.
\\AMD Radeon ProRender: A rendering software designed to produce highly detailed objects and photorealistic images.
\\AMD Ryzen Master Utility: The simple overclocking utility for AMD Ryzen processors.
\\AMD StoreMI Technology: An easy way to expand and accelerate the storage in a PC with an AMD Ryzen processor.
\\Outside of this AMD has taken steps to create machine learning and self-regulating CPUs in an effort to increase efficiency and hopefully to solve world issues.

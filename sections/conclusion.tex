We learned that AMD has a long and complex history. Though the company is now a thriving business this was not always the case. From humble beginnings, to a bitter rival to INTEL, Advanced Micro Devices has left it's mark on the computing world and will continue to improve and advance how we see computer hardware and software for years to come.
